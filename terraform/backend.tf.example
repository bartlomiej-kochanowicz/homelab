# Terraform Cloud Backend Configuration Example
# 
# Copy this file to backend.tf and update with your organization/workspace
# backend.tf is gitignored to keep your configuration private

terraform {
  cloud {
    organization = "your-organization-name"

    workspaces {
      name = "homelab"
    }
  }
}

# Alternative: Use local backend (default if backend.tf doesn't exist)
# No configuration needed - Terraform will use local state files
